#### Cellpose installation commands

# Following applications need to be installed:
# 1. Github Desktop app: https://desktop.github.com/
# 2. Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/

## Step 1: Clone github repository
# 1. Open Github Desktop app
# 2. Press CTRL+Shift+O
# 3. Change to "URL"
# 4. Enter "https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose.git" and click on "Clone"
# Now the repository will be saved under "\Users\user.name\Documents\Github\cellpose"

## Step 2: Install packages from environment file via anaconda prompt
# Open the anaconda prompt by pressing the windows key and typing in "Anaconda Prompt"
# Navigate to the repository
cd \Users\<user.name>\Documents\GitHub\cellpose

# Create environment and install packages from .yml
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate environment
conda activate cellpose

# To use JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebooks we need to install two more packages
conda install jupyter
pip install matplotlib

# To upgrade cellpose you can run
pip install cellpose --upgrade

# If we want to run cellpose on CPU we are finished here and can run the GUI with following command
python -m cellpose

## (Optional) Step 3: Install GPU version
# uninstall CPU version of torch and install GPU version
pip uninstall torch
conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
conda install -c anaconda cudatoolkit

# to upgrade cellpose in the future you have to run following command instead of just 'pip install cellpose --upgrade' to prevent the CPU version getting installed again
pip install --no-deps cellpose --upgrade
